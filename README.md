Insurance Risk & Claims Dashboard

1. Project Goal
To develop a centralized, interactive Power BI dashboard for an insurance company. The dashboard will help stakeholders understand the policyholder base and claim patterns to make data-driven business decisions by consolidating scattered data sources into a single view.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard must provide a clear overview of the following core metrics:
Total Policies: To measure the size of the active customer base.
Total Claim Amount: To track the overall financial impact of claims.
Claim Frequency: To analyze how often claims are being made.
Average Claim Amount: To assess claim severity and risk exposure.
Gender-wise Total Policies: To understand customer distribution across genders.

3. Data Overview
The dataset contains comprehensive information about policyholders, their vehicles, and claim history. Key fields for analysis include:
Customer Demographics: Birthdate, Gender, Marital Status, Education.
Vehicle Details: Car Make, Car Model, Car Year, Car Use.
Financial & Risk Factors: Claim Amount, Claim Frequency, Household Income, Coverage Zone, and Kids Driving.

4. Required Visualizations
The analysis will be driven by interactive charts that explore patterns across various segments:

By Car Use (Donut Chart)
By Car Make (Bar Chart)
By Coverage Zone (Donut Chart)
By Age Group (Histogram)
By Car Year (Area Chart)
By Kids Driving (Ribbon Chart)
By Education & Marital Status (Matrix Heat Grid)
